# Understanding-Distributions-Through-Sampling-Animated-Plotting-

This repository shows an example of interactive plotting in matplotlib. Sampes are generated from 4 different distributions (exponential, normal, gamma and uniform) and these samples are plotted, point by point, in a figure to slowly generate distributions. The shapes 
of the graphs convege on the shape of the distibutions as n increases on side. The graph is also interactive in the sense that that a freezeframe of the sampling up until that point can be obtained by clicking on the graph.
